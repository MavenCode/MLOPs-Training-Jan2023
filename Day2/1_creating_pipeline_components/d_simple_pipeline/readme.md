### Simple Pipeline 

#### Creating kubeflow pipeline for a machine learning workflow

This is an example of a kubeflow pipeline designed to carry out the steps involved in a simple machine learning workflow. 

lightweight components are created for the following steps 

1.  data ingestion
2.  data preprocessing
3.  Model training
4.  Model evaluation
5.  model inferencing 

the components are linked together to form a kubeflow pipeline.
